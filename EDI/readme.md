# Abstract

The goal of the project is to construct an Affordable Small Radio Telescope (ASRT) that will allow students to participate in radio astronomy. With components from Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite systems operating in the radio frequency (RF) framework, the ASRT offers a user-friendly platform for astronomical observations, with a special emphasis on solar studies. With the help of low-noise block converters (LNBs) and parabolic dish antennas, the ASRT provides students with an inexpensive way to investigate radio astronomy methods. The project places a strong emphasis on experiential learning by letting students assemble and use the telescope under supervision. Students' comprehension of signal capture and processing is improved by the ASRT by utilising the concepts of RF engineering and analogue communication. Through the use of the ASRT, students can conduct solar observations that provide insights into solar variability and phenomena.Overall, the ASRT project contributes to advancing education in both radio astronomy and engineering, fostering interest in scientific exploration and providing a valuable learning experience for students.

# Introduction

* The study of celestial objects through their radio wave emissions is known as radio astronomy. Historically, this area has only been accessible to research organizations with substantial funding due to its reliance on huge, expensive equipment. But more recently, developments have produced compact and more reasonably priced radio telescope options, opening up this exciting field of astronomy to a wider audience. The current effort is focused on building an Affordable Small Radio Telescope (ASRT), primarily for solar observations. The purpose of this Introduction is to provide an overview of the project's goals, reasoning, and importance in relation to science and engineering.
* The necessity for affordable and easily obtainable resources to investigate the Sun, our closest star, and its diverse occurrences is the main driving force behind the creation of an ASRT. Solar activity, which is typified by phenomena like Sunspots and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), has practical consequences for Earth's technological infrastructure in addition to providing insightful information about stellar dynamics. Researchers can improve their understanding of space weather phenomena and lessen the possibility of interference with GPS navigation, network systems, satellite communication, and electrical grids by keeping an eye on and evaluating solar activity.
The research offers an interesting chance for me as an RF engineer to apply ideas and concepts from communication engineering to radio astronomy. The ASRT makes use of parts that are frequently used in Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite systems, such as coaxial cables, satellite dishes, and Low-Noise Block (LNB) converters. The project showcases the integration of RF engineering and astronomy by recycling these components and incorporating them into a working radio telescope. This provides an interactive method of learning about both fields.
* The process used to build the ASRT centers on putting these parts together and integrating them to create a functional system that can identify radio signals from celestial bodies, especially the Sun. The project makes use of the RF framework and analogue communication concepts in the telescope's construction and calibration to ensure that radio signals are captured and processed as efficiently as possible. Students and hobbyists bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and actual applications by gaining practical expertise in hardware assembly, signal acquisition, and data analysis through this procedure.
* The ASRT-facilitated observations yield important data for researching solar phenomena and how space weather forecasting is affected by them. Through monitoring the frequency and trajectory of CMEs, Sunspots, and other solar phenomena, scientists can improve predictive models and algorithms, improving our capacity to foresee and lessen possible effects on Earth's technological infrastructure. In addition, the ASRT's accessibility and affordability make it a perfect teaching tool, encouraging upcoming generations of engineers and scientists to discover the mysteries of radio astronomy.
* In the final analysis, a major advancement in STEM education and scientific research has been made with the creation of an affordable small radio telescope for solar studies. The ASRT provides a singular opportunity to include enthusiasts and students in experiential learning while deepening our understanding of the Sun and its influence on space weather by fusing ideas from RF engineering and astronomy. As the project develops, it has the potential to make significant contributions to the domains of space research, radio astronomy, and communication engineering, opening the door for further advancements and discoveries.

# Novelty
The unique aspect of our work is its capacity to identify radio emissions from RLC circuits, blackbody radiations, and satellites (figure16). Through the integration of physics insights and electronics and telecom engineering concepts, we have developed a prototype model that spans multiple interdisciplinary fields. This convergence of knowledge has opened up new directions for creative study and useful applications by allowing us to investigate a variety of phenomena in radio astronomy. 
The project's importance was acknowledged during IUCAA's National Science Day, where it was on display and highlighted how it has advanced scientific understanding and encouraged interdisciplinary cooperation in the fields of engineering and astronomy.
