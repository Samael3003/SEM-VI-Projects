# Abstract

In compliance with the IEEE-754 standard, this project paper does a comprehensive investigation into comparators operating at several precision levels: half-precision (float-16) , single-precision (float-32), and double-precision (float-64). IEEE-754 standard specifies formats that computer systems must use to represent floating-point numbers. These formats control how arithmetic operations behave and how special values like NaN and infinity are handled. We analyze performance indicators, operational nuances, structural design, and real-world applications of comparators at each precision level. Through the examination of factors such as precision, speed, and resource consumption, this research seeks to clarify the complex trade-offs associated with choosing a suitable degree of precision for certain computing activities. The knowledge gained from this study is very helpful in developing dependable and effective floating-point arithmetic units for use in digital systems.


# Introduction

* An essential foundation controlling the representation and arithmetic operations of floating-point numbers in computer systems is the IEEE 754 standard, which was created in 1985 and updated in 2008. It specifies formats for binary encoding of real numbers, together with rules for arithmetic operations, rounding techniques, and handling of special instances like overflow and underflow. It also specifies precision levels, including half, single, and double precision. For complicated numerical computations to be executed with accuracy and dependability in computer architecture, IEEE 754-compliant floating-point arithmetic units must be implemented as efficiently as possible. This means that the IEEE 754 standard must be followed in the design and optimisation of digital circuits that can precisely perform arithmetic operations on floating-point integers.
* In order to realise digital circuits that comply with IEEE 754, sophisticated hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog are used to make the description and synthesis of digital designs easier. Utilising resources such as Xilinx Vivado software, designers are able to build and create digital circuits that are intended for certain FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) devices, like the Kintex-7 family's xc7k70tfbv676-1. The creation of complicated digital systems, including IEEE 754-compliant floating-point arithmetic units, is made possible by the programmable logic blocks provided by these FPGA devices.
* Comparators are essential in the field of digital design because they make it easier to do a variety of tasks, such as searching, sorting, and making decisions. Comparators generate output signals, such as equality, greater than, or less than, based on their comparison of the magnitudes of two operands. Within the framework of our project, we examine comparators that follow the IEEE 754 standard and operate at half, single, and double precision. Optimising the design of floating-point arithmetic units that are suited to certain computational needs and resource limitations requires an understanding of the mechanics and performance traits of these comparators. Through our investigation, we aim to provide insights into the design considerations and trade-offs involved in implementing comparators compliant with the IEEE 754 standard, ultimately contributing to the development of efficient and reliable floating-point arithmetic units in digital systems.

# Conclusion

To sum up, this project offers a thorough examination of comparators that adhere to the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic and operate at different precision levels. By means of a thorough examination of performance metrics, operational subtleties, and structural blueprint, the research clarifies the intricate balances required to determine precision thresholds for floating-point calculations. The results emphasise the necessity of optimising design to properly balance precision, performance, and resource consumption, as well as the significance of following the IEEE 754 standard to guarantee consistency and compatibility across computer systems. The creation of trustworthy and effective floating-point arithmetic units has practical ramifications as well, especially in fields where accuracy and dependability are crucial. This research advances digital systems that can accurately perform complex numerical computations and improves their suitability for a variety of scientific, engineering, and industrial applications by providing insights into design considerations and performance characteristics.
