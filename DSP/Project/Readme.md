The Butterfly Detection and Identification presents a deep learning-based approach for butterfly species detection and identification in the biodiverse Sahyadri region of Maharashtra, India. Leveraging the ResNet50 architecture, the model achieves a notable accuracy of 93.2% on a comprehensive dataset comprising 100 butterfly species. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology in automating the identification process, thereby aiding biodiversity conservation efforts. The findings underscore the potential of deep learning techniques in addressing ecological challenges and contribute to the advancement of species monitoring and management practices.
